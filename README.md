# BAAL - Professional Network Visualizer

## Idea

As networking is becoming increasingly important during this day and age, we wanted to make a tool to organize our connections and simplify the process. The main part of our tool is the network visualizer, which shows the connections between you and people who you add, allowing you to keep track of the people you've recently met with and have been connected to.

With connections to Linkedin so that you can quickly populate information, AI email templates to streamline the creation of thank you and update emails, and calendar integration to help you schedule different meetings and notify you when you need to follow-up with someone, we created a useful tool for young professionals trying to better organize their lives
